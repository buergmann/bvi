New in release 1.4.2
====================
This release is dedicated to Sven Guckes (*1967-04-06 +2022-02-20).
Sven was an enthusiastic Linux explainer, his particular passion was the console tools.
I met Sven a couple of times. He always showed interest in the further development of
the bvi and liked to discuss new ideas.
