BVI - Binary visual editor

How to compile
==============

	You need the curses (ncurses) library for cursor movement on your system. 
	https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-install-ncurses-library-headers-on-debian-ubuntu-centos-fedora/


	gunzip -c bvi-1.4.2.src.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	cd bvi-1.4.2
	./configure
	make
	make install


MAC OS X
========
Looks like the curses implementation in Darwin is really limited.
You should install and use ncurses instead. You can download it from
ftp.gnu.org; install it and then use
	./configure --with-ncurses=/usr/local/ncurses-5.2

The Control-y key sequence suspends bvi and send it to the background.
To avoid this behaviour use:
	stty dsusp undef
